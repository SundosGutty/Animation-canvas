# Animation-canvas
The HTML canvas element is used to draw graphics using scripting language like JavaScript. It is one of the latest updates of HTML5. 
It allows for dynamic and scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images.
In this project which I build during my coding course, I use Canvas to draw a dog in different positions. <img width="1010" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-17 at 16 08 29" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91906842/225929309-e638ec26-d5fc-42a9-b6f1-5995853c387f.png">
